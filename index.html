                <p>I’m from a middle class family. In my school life I was a brilliant student and my academic result shows it. In 2013 I wanted to go abroad but I was rejected by the Uk Embassy. I was very frustrated and I went to Malaysia for IT course but the College wasn’t good as they are Tamil cheater captured my passport and that’s why I cancelled my course with them. I returned Bangladesh and completed my graduation here. Now I’m job less but optimistic. I was inspired by one of younger brother Tamim to do this course as well as it was one of my passion. Thanks to Jhankar Mahbub Sir to operate such awesome courses.</p>
