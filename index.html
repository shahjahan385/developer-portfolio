                <h2>World-class professional web Developer</h2>
                <p style="text-align:left;">My name is Shahjahan. I have been on a long unfortunate journey, but am still optimistic to succeed. 
                    My education was Brilliant, I always got top Marks and applied for a scholarship at Coventry University in the Uk, unfortunately my Visa was rejected. I did not give up; I went on to applying in Malaysia which I got into. Undoubtedly this turned out to be a mess up.
 
                    Then decided to return to Bangladesh and finish my graduation which I done so successfully. I have managed to develop a family business, but this was not for I wanted to do something more with my life and recognized it was working with technology and wanted to be a web developer.
                    I was inspired by a very dear brother 'Tamim' to do this course as well as it was one of my passion. Thanks to Jhankar Mahbub Sir to operate such awesome courses.
